This script was written to help me tidy up my keepass database.

If you decide to use this, copy the database file, just incase anything happens to go wrong, you're not then working on the original (backup). then just start using the copy.

```python
import os
import pykeepass
from openai import OpenAI
import time
import re

'''
read the kdbx file durosyan.kdbx make sure to use the key file durosyan.keyx, 
and a password read from an environment variable, 
then find all the entries in the groups:

...

For each of these groups, print out the number of entries that do not have a username
'''

# Set your OpenAI API key
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
model = "gpt-4o"

# Read password from environment variable
password = os.getenv('KEEPASS_PASSWORD')

def get_login_url(service_name):
    prompt = f"Find the login URL for the service: {service_name} respond only with the URL, do not include any other information, do not include any other text other than the url."
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Open the KeePass database
kp = pykeepass.PyKeePass('/path/to/file.kdbx', 
                         keyfile='path/to/file.keyx', 
                         password=password)

# List of groups to check
groups_to_check = [
    ...
]

# Iterate over each group and count entries without a username
for group_name in groups_to_check:
    group = kp.find_groups(name=group_name, first=True)
    if group:
        entries_without_url = [entry for entry in group.entries if not entry.url]
        for entry in entries_without_url:
            print(f"Entry without URL: {entry.title}")
            # url = get_login_url(entry.title)
            # if re.match(r'^(https?|ftp)://[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*$', url):
            #     entry.url = url
            #     print(f"\033[92mURL for {entry.title}: {entry.url}\033[0m")
            # else:
            #     print(f"\033[91mInvalid URL for {entry.title}: {url}\033[0m")

        print(f"Group '{group_name}' has {len(entries_without_url)} entries without a URL.")

    else:
        print(f"Group '{group_name}' not found.")

# Save the changes
# kp.save()
```

this will be the output:
