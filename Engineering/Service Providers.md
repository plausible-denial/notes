A super cool hosting provider, what we call cloud computing.

There are deployed physical data centres all over the world, sea, and maybe one day beyond our planet.

These are owned and operated by various organisations and people.

When they aren’t using their computers, they like to sell time on them.

When they have free space on their servers, they sell that too.

There are different reasons someone might want to utilise this and there are many prebuilt solutions that come along with various providers of resources.

Think “X” as a service.

This is economical, but also valuable for other small businesses that don’t have the time to invest in setting up all this ***STUFF*** they need to get their business running well.
