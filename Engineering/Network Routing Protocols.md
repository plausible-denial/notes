# Routing Protocols

Some modern routing protocols include:

Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
Interior Gateway Protocol (IGRP)
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)

The purpose of routing protocols is to learn of available routes that exist on the enterprise network, build routing tables and make routing decisions.
