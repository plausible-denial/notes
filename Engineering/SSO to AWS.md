title: SSO to AWS
---

This is one of those things I wanted to setup automatically, Although I seriously think this is one of those extremely complicated things.

One click setup for a multi cloud account from scratch with provided details:

- Card details
- Name
- Phone number
- Email
- Address

Pretty scary stuff considering I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm hoping that doing it multiple times will help me understand how to go about the process and eventually automate it.

The main reasoning behind doing this is because I'd like to be able to setup a business cloud environment very quickly without having to worry about specific step details.

This would help businesses benefit from each different cloud tenants services without having to sacrifice on ease of use.

This also centralises user management to one single place.

For me this allows me to use my microsoft identity with AWS, & GCP (Big Three Cloud).
