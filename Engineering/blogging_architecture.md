# Blogging architecture

I want to create a blog.

I want to create minimal carbon footprint whilst doing so.

There are many ways I could do this.

I have all my content stored in github.

I already have the content available to be pushed into GhostCMS.

I already have a potential deployment of Ghost ready to go onto AWS.

The only problem I face is that it is slow to respond once I get all the content in and out of it.

I also could just do this: `npx gatsby new gatsby-starter-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

and be done with it.

A wise man once said: keep it simple stupid.

I'm writing this because i'm simply tired and don't know what else to write lol
