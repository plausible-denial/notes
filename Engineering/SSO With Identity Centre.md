title: SSO With Identity Centre

So this is moved on from the days of cognito.

I want to follow these guides and hopefully I'll end up with the ability to get temporary access to AWS via the CLI?

- [AWS | single sign on | configure profile token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html)
- [AWS | single sign on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/useraccess.html#assignusers)
- [AWS | single sign on | getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)

The flow for me would be then:

1. Turn on laptop
2. Boot docker & windows subsystem for linux
3. ?


Then, I create an administrative group and added myself as a user, with the username Admin.

In the future I would like to have this sysnced to an Azure Entra.
