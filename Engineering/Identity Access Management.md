# Identity Access Management

Identity and access.

How does a business maintain access to work on its intellectual property and assets, whilst ensuring security of value attained from said assets.

What threats are there to reputation, finance, operation, people?

Especially in time of crisis, how is it known what is done and when it is done?

What does it even mean to be working in an airgap? what is first party, second party, third party?

How do you maintain zero network trust?

What responses are there to stimulus of event.

Reaction

Initiative

Prediction

## Access Management Details

A business maintains access to work on its intellectual property and assets by using robust access management systems. These systems assign roles to individuals based on their job requirements, limit access to sensitive information, and monitor all access attempts.

Threats to reputation, finance, operation, people could come from both internal and external sources. Internally, a disgruntled employee might misuse their access privileges. Externally, hackers might try to compromise the system and gain unauthorized access.

In times of crisis, businesses can use audit logs to track what actions were taken and when. These logs provide a detailed record of all activity within the system.

Working in an airgap means that a computer or network is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public internet. This is a security measure to protect sensitive data.

First-party refers to the entity itself (e.g., the business), second-party refers to a partner or direct relationship (e.g., a contractor or supplier), and third-party refers to a company or service that is not directly linked to the business but provides a necessary service (e.g., a cloud service provider).

Maintaining zero network trust involves always verifying all requests for access, regardless of where they come from. This means not trusting any request by default, even if it comes from within the network.

Responses to the stimulus of an event can include immediate reactions (e.g., shutting down a compromised system), taking initiative to prevent future incidents (e.g., implementing stronger access controls), and prediction (e.g., using machine learning to predict and prevent future threats).
