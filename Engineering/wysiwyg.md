# What you see is what you get

What you see is what you get editors have been around for a while. Remember Dreamweaver? There are plenty of good use cases for them.

## The Limitations of WYSIWYG

While WYSIWYG editors are user-friendly and great for quick edits, they often fall short in terms of flexibility and control. They can generate bloated or inefficient code, and may not support all the features that a developer needs. Additionally, they can sometimes obscure the underlying HTML and CSS, making it harder to troubleshoot issues or implement custom functionality.

Despite these limitations, WYSIWYG editors remain a valuable tool for many users, especially those who are less familiar with coding. By understanding their strengths and weaknesses, you can make the most of these tools while knowing when to switch to a more code-centric approach.

## Popular WYSIWYG editors

There are several popular WYSIWYG editors available today, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Some of the most widely used include:

- **TinyMCE**: A versatile and customizable editor that integrates well with various content management systems.
- **CKEditor**: Known for its robust feature set and ease of integration.
- **Froala**: Offers a clean and modern interface with a focus on performance.
