# Unlocking the Power of Azure: Free Services You Can Utilize Today

In the vast realm of cloud computing, Microsoft Azure stands tall as a premier service provider, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to support businesses and developers. An enticing aspect of Azure is its array of services available for free, making it an attractive option for startups, hobbyists, and even established enterprises looking to explore cloud solutions without immediate financial commitments.

One standout feature of Azure is its free tier, where users can enjoy a variety of services at no cost. Among these, Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) remain a highlight, offering 750 hours of usage per month for certain models during the first 12 months. This means you can experiment with setting up and running VMs without worrying about the bill.

Database enthusiasts can take advantage of Azure SQL Database, with 100,000 vCore seconds of serverless usage offered each month. If storage solutions are what you seek, Azure Blob Storage provides you with 5 GB of locally redundant storage for streamlined data management.

Developers keen on building modern applications can leverage Azure App Service to create web, mobile, or API apps with a free allowance of 10 apps and 1 GB of storage. For those looking to integrate intelligent capabilities, Azure AI offers resources such as the Anomaly Detector and Bot Service, enabling innovative applications without incurring costs for a significant volume of usage.

These free services extend to more than just development and storage. Azure’s offerings include personalized recommendations via Azure Advisor, seamless API management, and tools like Azure Automation, which simplifies cloud management tasks. With over 55 services available at no cost, Azure’s free-tier offerings are plentiful and diverse.
