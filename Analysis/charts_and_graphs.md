# Charts And Graphs

Datavisualisation is an interesting topic of discussion. Communication of data through different mediums is something I am keenly interested in. Although incredibly difficult to grasp how to create these visualisations.

Personally in my experience we have tools like 

- Splunk
- Grafana
- Opensearch
- Kibana and elastic search

These are data injestion and visualisation platforms.

and then we have induvidual libraries

- Matplot lib
- Plotly
- Chart.js
- D3.js
- Cytoscape
