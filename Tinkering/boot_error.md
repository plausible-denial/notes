This pops up everytime I boot up... I don't know why. and I don't really want to go down the rabbit hole of boot sectors and corebooting my laptop again tbh.

```
failed to open \EFI\BOOT\? - Invalid Parameter
failed to load image ? - invalid parameter
start_image() returned invalid parameter, falling back to default loader
```
