## Notes

The cable is pretty hard to find from any where reputable. for good reason probs.

on my macbook model A1502 (Late 2013 I think) it has an empty connector at the far edge of the loagic board near the removable storage m.2 (nvram).

the ram on this board is not removable. just notes.

> this would be better off just paying the Â£220 for both the macbook and the imac to have the firmware flashed.
