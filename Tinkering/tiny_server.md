Learn lots. Basically this is just a hobby. One of the fun things I like to research.

Running my portfolio site on the tiniest of servers. Save the planet and everything.

Being able to move away from vendor specific implementations of essentially a web host. Implementing selinux and iptables policies, for process/network isolation. Vendor neutral wherever possible.

## Why This Might Be a Bad Idea

While running a tiny server can be an interesting and educational hobby, there are several potential drawbacks and risks to consider:

1. **Security Risks**: Small servers, especially those managed by hobbyists, can be more vulnerable to security breaches if not properly maintained and updated. Ensuring all software is up-to-date and configuring security measures correctly can be challenging.

2. **Performance Limitations**: Tiny servers may not have the resources to handle high traffic or resource-intensive applications. This can lead to slow performance or even downtime if the server is overwhelmed.

3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Managing a server requires regular maintenance, including software updates, security patches, and backups. This can be time-consuming and requires a certain level of expertise.

4. **Reliability Issues**: Consumer-grade hardware and internet connections may not be as reliable as professional hosting services. This can result in more frequent outages and less consistent performance.

5. **Scalability Challenges**: As your needs grow, scaling a tiny server can be difficult. You may eventually need to migrate to a more robust solution, which can be complex and time-consuming.

6. **Compliance and Legal Concerns**: Depending on the data you are hosting, there may be legal and compliance requirements that are difficult to meet with a small, self-managed server.

Considering these factors, it's important to weigh the benefits of running a tiny server against the potential challenges and risks.

## Why This Might Be a Good Idea

Despite the potential drawbacks, there are several reasons why running a tiny server can be a good idea:

1. **Learning Experience**: Managing your own server provides hands-on experience with system administration, networking, and security. This can be valuable for personal growth and career development.

2. **Cost Savings**: Using a tiny server can be more cost-effective than paying for commercial hosting services, especially for small projects or personal websites.

3. **Customization and Control**: Running your own server gives you complete control over the software and configurations. You can tailor the environment to meet your specific needs and preferences.

4. **Privacy and Security**: By managing your own server, you have greater control over your data and can implement security measures that meet your standards. This can be particularly important for sensitive or personal information.

5. **Independence from Vendors**: Operating your own server allows you to avoid vendor lock-in and dependency on third-party services. This can provide more flexibility and freedom in how you manage your projects.

6. **Environmental Impact**: Using a tiny server with low power consumption can be more environmentally friendly than relying on large data centers with higher energy usage.

7. **Community and Collaboration**: Running a server can connect you with a community of like-minded individuals who share tips, resources, and support. This can enhance your learning and make the experience more enjoyable.

By carefully managing the potential risks and challenges, running a tiny server can be a rewarding and beneficial endeavor.
