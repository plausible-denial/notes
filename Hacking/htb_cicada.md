a walkthrough for the box: [hackmd.io/@Abzee/Cicada](https://hackmd.io/@Abzee/Cicada)

I think for the first few months I will be following walkthroughs, at least until I get a grasp of some basic hacks and where to start investigations. hopefully in a few months I will be more autonomous in how I approach investigating vulns.

I don't know why 139, 445 are interesting ports to first look into, it's netbios-ssn on 139, and idk what 445 is.

it looks like a domain controller for a windows network.

445 is SMB [port=445](https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=445)
